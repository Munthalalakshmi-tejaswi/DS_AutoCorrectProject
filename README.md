 This project implements a simple Auto Correct / Auto Suggest feature using Trie Data Structure in Java.
When the user types a word:
->If the word exists in the dictionary â†’ it confirms the word is correct.
->If the word does not exist, the program suggests similar words that start with the same prefix.
